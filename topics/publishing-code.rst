Publishing code as part of an open source project
=================================================

There is several ways how to publish code:

* Modifying a project by changing its source code
  * A change integrating or modifying a piece of code
  * Using an internal extension mechanism
  * Creating a new project which is a modification of the original one (fork)

* Extending a project by publishing an extension (addon, plugin, package)
  * In an official place (repository)
  * In an unofficial place (repository)

* Creating an a new project
  * Using minimal dependencies (e.g. C or Python)
  * Leveraging existing projects (e.g. QGIS, GRASS GIS)

We will focus on ways which are using existing projects as a dependency
providing basic functionality and a place (channel) for publishing.

Authors of the following paper wrote the code as a GRASS GIS module
and included (or asked for inclusion of) the module into GRASS GIS.

Extension in an official repository
```````````````````````````````````

Authors of the following paper wrote the code as a GRASS GIS module
and put the module to the official GRASS GIS Addons repository.

Independent extension of the project

Authors of the following paper wrote the code as a GRASS GIS module
and published the code on GitHub.

Independent project using on an existing project

Authors of the following paper present their code as a standalone
project called RHESSys. From point of view of this project,
GRASS GIS is a dependency. At the same time, significant part of the
code is implemented as GRASS GIS modules.

GRASS GIS
---------

GRASS GIS is a free and open source desktop geographic system
and geospatial analytics library which serves as a platform for
open science. It is licensed under GNU GPL.

Official website and download: https://grass.osgeo.org

Official instructions for contributing and publishing code through
the project:

https://grass.osgeo.org/development/code-submission/

Example of a GRASS GIS module implemented in Python (see the source
code link at the bottom of the page):

Assignment
----------

Take some geospatial procedure you performed and write it as a GRASS GIS
Python module, i.e. Python script including interface description,
documentation and a (trivial) Makefile. Publish this using GitHub or
other service (we would use an official GRASS GIS Addons repository
in a real case). Then try to install it from that source locally
(currently, you need to use Linux or Mac OS to do that, use NCSU VCL if
needed).

If you don't have a good procedure you want to script, you can implement
some trivial process.
