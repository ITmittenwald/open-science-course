Assignment
----------

Take some geospatial procedure you performed and write it as a GRASS GIS
Python module, i.e. Python script including interface description,
documentation and a (trivial) Makefile. Publish this using GitHub or
other service (we would use an official GRASS GIS Addons repository
in a real case). Then try to install it from that source locally
(currently, you need to use Linux or Mac OS to do that, use NCSU VCL if
needed).

If you don't have a good procedure you want to script, you can implement
some trivial process.
