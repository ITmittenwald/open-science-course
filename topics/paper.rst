Assignment
----------

Try to reproduce the following paper:

* https://doi.org/10.1186/s40965-017-0021-8

Report on how that went and how far did you get.
Based on the last lecture, identify what may prevent others from
reproducing the results of this paper and based on the whole class,
identify what may prevent others from reusing methods and code presented
in the paper. Consider how that may work in the future and consider
also different potential audiences.
