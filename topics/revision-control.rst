Assignment
----------

The assignment has four parts. First, install Git on your computer.

Second, go to your document in Overleaf
from the last assignment or create some other test document in Overleaf.
Go to *Share* and use the *Clone With Git* option. Use this in your
local Git installation to clone the repository. In command line,
the operation looks something like:

::

    git clone https://git.overleaf.com/somehash

Make some changes, commit, push, and see what happened in Overleaf.
Then make some changes in Overleaf and then pull in your desktop
installation. You can repeat that so you feel comfortable.

Third, create a repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or some other
Git service. The will be a guide, wizard, or form which will lead you
through it. Then clone the repository on your computer and do some
commits.
Again, you can repeat that so you feel comfortable.

Fourth, submit changes to some repository which is not yours.
For this we will use GitHub, but the workflow would be similar in other
cases as well. You can choose from two options how to do that. Different
projects prefer one or the other. We will use the following repository
as the repository we are trying to submit changes to.

URL to be added

You can submit a patch (aka diff) as a file.
