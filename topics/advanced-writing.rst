LaTeX with Overleaf
```````````````````

https://www.overleaf.com

Overleaf is a freemium cloud platform with core processing
backend - LaTeX - which is open source software.

Overleaf project can be downloaded as a ZIP file of text files and
images which can be processed on any computer with LaTeX installed.
Typical LaTeX installation consist of several backend (command line)
tools such as *tex* or *pdflatex* and a dedicated text editor,
for example *Texmaker* or *Kile*,
which understands the LaTeX syntax and can compile the files into
an output document, typically PDF.
Thanks to this, Overleaf is a cloud platform which provides users
with a way out, thus preserving their freedom (in the area of software,
tools, and service providers).

Overleaf also has a rich text mode which is good for people who don't
know LaTeX.

ShareLaTeX
``````````

https://www.sharelatex.com

ShareLaTeX is a freemium cloud platform and an open source software
(i.e. you can either use the freemium cloud platform or setup ShareLaTeX
on any server).
ShareLaTeX is using GNU AGPL license.

Markdown with Pandoc
````````````````````

Pandoc is licensed under GNU GPL.

reStructuredText with Sphinx/Docutils
`````````````````````````````````````

reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net

Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org

reStructuredText is an plain text markup syntax similar to
aforementioned Markdown. It is often used for software
documentation, for example in Python docstrings.
reStructuredText is, unlike Markdown, designed for extensibility for
specific application domains.
reStructuredText is applicable to non-trivial cases like LaTeX,
but still striving to keep simple syntax like Markdown.

Docutils is an open-source text processing system for processing
plain text into formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, man-pages, open-document
or XML.
Docutils processes reStructuredText and can be used from command line
or as a Python package. Another software which can process
reStructuredText in a similar manner is Pandoc.

Sphinx is a tool that creates documentation from reStructuredText sources.
It is used for Python documentation and it is universal enough to be
used for software projects in general.
The output formats include HTML, LaTeX (for printable PDF versions),
ePub, and more.
Sphinx uses the Docutils to parse the reStructuredText.

Sphinx is licensed under BSD and Docutils are placed into public domain.
