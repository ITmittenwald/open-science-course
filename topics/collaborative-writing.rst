Open access and licenses
````````````````````````

Publishing an article as open access is usually achieved by licensing
it using one of the Creative Commons licenses.

For example, MPDI uses CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution License).
In `a description of an article <http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/2/942>`_
MPDI says:

    This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons
    Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution,
    and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work
    is properly cited. (CC BY 4.0).

CC BY is also used, for example, by PLOS and it is the most common
license used for open access articles.

Another license commonly used for open access articles is CC BY-NC
(Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License)
sometimes combined also with ND (NoDerivatives) part
(CC BY-NC-ND or CC BY-ND) preventing commercial use and modifications.
What that exactly means in each particular case is often hard to
determine [Redhead, 2012], but it is clear that these licenses
doen't fulfill the Open Definition:

    Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any
    purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance
    and openness).

The "preservation of provenance" part is for example the attribution in CC BY
and the "preservation of openness" part can be found for example in
CC BY-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License).
CC BY-SA is sometimes used for open access articles and is quite
commonly used in general, for example at Wikipedia.
The CC BY-SA license requires that the derived works are distributed
only under the same or similar license.

Creative Common licenses have both "human-readable summaries"
and a full legal language license documents.
