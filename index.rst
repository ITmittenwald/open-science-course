NCSU GIS 610-003/603: Tools for open geospatial science
=======================================================

Description
-----------

The course will cover emerging field of open science and will deal with
reproducibility and replicability challenges of computational research.
The students will gain a hands-on experience with tools used by
scientists to create geospatial research which can be validated by the
wider geospatial community. Several geospatial open source tools will
be discussed in connection with general-purpose and text authoring
tools such as next generation interactive documents and revision
control tools. Although the focus of the course is open science, many
of the tools used in the course are used in the industry. The course
will cover how open source communities and software development process
work and how to apply this for research in a lab group. Students will
have an option to participate in writing a collaborative publication
covering the course topics.
