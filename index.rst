NCSU GIS 610-003/603: Tools for open geospatial science
=======================================================

Description
-----------

The course will cover emerging field of open science and will deal with
reproducibility and replicability challenges of computational research.
The students will gain a hands-on experience with tools used by
scientists to create geospatial research which can be validated by the
wider geospatial community. Several geospatial open source tools will
be discussed in connection with general-purpose and text authoring
tools such as next generation interactive documents and revision
control tools. Although the focus of the course is open science, many
of the tools used in the course are used in the industry. The course
will cover how open source communities and software development process
work and how to apply this for research in a lab group. Students will
have an option to participate in writing a collaborative publication
covering the course topics.

Assignments are always due the next week at the end of the day
of the on-campus class which is Wednesday.

November 29 is time to wrap up the class, to work on reproducible paper,
or to complete what we missed in the previous weeks.

Relevant conferences during the semester:
FOSS4G Boston (August 14-19, open source geospatial software),
JupyterCon NY, (August 22-25),
State of the Map US Boulder (October 19-22, OpenStreetMap),
AllThingsOpen Raleigh (October 23-24), and
AGU New Orleans (December 11-15, several sessions related to open).

Instructor
----------

Vaclav Petras and Helena Mitasova

Office hours (Vaclav Petras):
Tuesday 3:00 - 4:00pm and Thursday 3:00 - 4:00pm.
Before coming confirm by email the time and date (vpetras).

Software
--------

Several geospatial open source tools such as QGIS and GRASS GIS
will be discussed in connection with general-purpose and text authoring
tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and Git. Here is a detailed list
(subject to change):

1. Open science
2. Authorea and Markdown
3. LaTeX (in Overleaf)
4. Git, GitHub (Markdown, Overleaf, wiki, Zim)
5. QGIS
6. Linux, command line (Bash), SSH
7. GRASS GIS
8. Jupyter (and R Markdown)
9. Writing GRASS GIS module in Python (alternatives: QGIS, R)
10. Leaflet and leaflet-rastercoords with gdal2tiles --leaflet (plus OSM)
11. GDAL
12. Open source development
13. Docker (and Vagrant)
14. Writing and reproducing an open science paper

All the software used in the course is open source, so students can
install it on their computers without obtaining licenses from the vendors
or through the university. Some free of charge services based on open
source software or focused on open science or open source development
will be used too.

The following additional tools can be discussed as well:

* Presentation tools: Reveal.js, LaTeX Beamer, R Markdown
* Poster tools: Tikz Poster, Beamer poster
* Image tools: ImageMagic, PIL, Graphviz
* Text tools: Pandoc
