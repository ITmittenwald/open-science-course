NCSU GIS 595-601: Tools for open geospatial science
===================================================

Description
-----------

The course will cover emerging field of open science and will deal with
reproducibility and replicability challenges of computational research.
The students will gain a hands-on experience with tools used by
scientists to create geospatial research which can be validated by the
wider geospatial community. Several geospatial open source tools will
be discussed in connection with general-purpose and text authoring
tools such as next generation interactive documents and revision
control tools. Although the focus of the course is open science, many
of the tools used in the course are used in the industry either for
building cloud services or for fast prototyping. The course
will cover how open source communities and software development process
work and how to apply this for research in a lab group.

10. July 25      `Writing and reproducing an open science paper <topics/paper.html>`_
    July 29      Remaining assignments due
    AugustÂ 1     Grades
=== ============ ===


Assignments are always due the next week on Mondays at the end of the
day, but it is recommended to finish them the following day
which is, for most of the days, intentionally left free.

The above applies also to the assignments from the last week of classes
(July 21-26) which are due on July 29.

Relevant conferences to keep an eye on:
FOSS4G and FOSS4G NA (open source geospatial software),
JupyterCon (project Jupyter),
State of the Map US (OpenStreetMap),
AllThingsOpen (Raleigh), and
AGU (usually includes several sessions related to open).

Grading
-------

This course is satisfactory/unsatisfactory (pass/fail).
There is 10 topics each with its own assignment. To pass the class,
you need to do and deliver at least 9 assignments. What you do for each
assignment needs to demonstrate sufficient level of understanding
and it needs to be delivered on time, otherwise it won't be counted
towards your 9 assignments and you need to redo it or do another one.
In other words, you can leave out one topic if you want and it is up to
you which one.

Software
--------

Several geospatial open source tools such as QGIS and GRASS GIS
will be discussed in connection with general-purpose and text authoring
tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and Git. Here is a detailed list
(subject to change):

1. Open science
2. Authorea and Markdown
3. LaTeX (in Overleaf)
4. Git, GitHub (Markdown, Overleaf, wiki, Zim)
5. QGIS
6. Linux, command line (Bash), SSH
7. GRASS GIS
8. Jupyter (and R Markdown)
9. Writing GRASS GIS module in Python (alternatives: QGIS, R)
10. Leaflet and leaflet-rastercoords with gdal2tiles --leaflet (plus OSM)
11. GDAL
12. Open source development
13. Docker (and Vagrant)
14. Writing and reproducing an open science paper

All the software used in the course is open source, so students can
install it on their computers without obtaining licenses from the vendors
or through the university. Some free of charge services based on open
source software or focused on open science or open source development
will be used too.

The following additional tools can be discussed as well:

* Presentation tools: Reveal.js, LaTeX Beamer, R Markdown
* Poster tools: Tikz Poster, Beamer poster
* Image tools: ImageMagic, PIL, Graphviz
* Text tools: Pandoc
