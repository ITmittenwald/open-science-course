Narrative for How we teach tools for open geospatial science
============================================================

Basic Topics
------------

Some things like for example how open source communities work are
mysterious for students, so we want to explain these things, but we
start with topics which are closer to what the students already know.

We start with scientific papers as most students are familiar with
papers usually in form of PDFs or HTML.

At the same time, they used tools such as Google Documents or Microsoft
Word, but we wanted to introduce them to tools which are more suitable
for scientific writing. Namely we used Overleaf and Authorea.
What is important about these tools is that they are great for
transitioning from point-and-click mindset and binary formats to
mindset which has plain text files as the baseline.
Overleaf is using LaTeX and Authorea is using Markdown spiced with
LaTeX and at the same time both tools allow students to do also
graphical rich text editing they are used to.
Having this as a topic which challenges the students seemed to work.
One student said that learning about LaTeX and Overleaf was in terms
of technology the most game-changing lecture in his college education.

You all are familiar with this system of versioning, but we know that
it is not the ideal one. Our students know this too.

So we want to show them how to use modern revision control tools to
manage versions of their files.

One thing with Git is that every student, and really everybody, is
confusing it with GitHub. We tried to our best to explain the difference
and also teach students about the alternatives and what to consider
when using a service like that.

Geospatial Topics
-----------------

We are of course most interested in the geospatial topics and that's
what we focus on the central part of the course.

When working with geospatial data, most people focus on the visual part,
they look at the input data, control the graphical user interface, and
create visual outputs. And that's also the case for our students.

The natural thing to do when everything is visual is to take screenshots
of everything if you want to record your steps.
But that's of course not something you put to a paper and even worse,
will these screenshots be usable with a different version of the
software or even on different operating system?

That's where scripting comes into play. Every line of code we are
looking at now represents the same as the three screenshots we have seen
before.
We actually don't teach scripting or even programming to students.
That's something which is covered in a different course and which
definitively deserves at least a whole course.
Most students who took the open science course this semester
had some experience with scripting although it was not necessarily
working experience.
