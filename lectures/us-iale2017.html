<section>
scientific community we have been largely unsuccessful in sharing our research methods and results in a reproducible way.
</section>


<section>
current scientific publishing requires more than writing a paper
new ways of sharing our research

    <blockquote style="width: 100%; margin: 0.1em;">
        <p>
            Software [...] developed as part of novel methods is as important
            for the method's implementation [...]
            Such software [...] must be made available to readers upon publication.

of hoping we entered the same values as last time when rerunning the analysis with a new climate dataset.

Finally Docker and Vagrant let us wrap entire workflow into one runtime environment
so that our species distribution model can be used without our personal laptop.

This talk will discuss several tools for reproducible research
and show practical examples which will make your life and lives of your colleagues easier.

<section>
A terrain modeling paper will serve as an example of sharing a full description
of a published method.
A landscape change model will be used to demonstrate reusable research.
Finally, a paper about vegetation structure will show how all pieces
of the puzzle fit together.
