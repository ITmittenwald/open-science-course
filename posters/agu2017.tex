% Open science uses open source to deal with reproducibility challenges in data and computational sciences. However, just using open source software or making the code public does not make the research reproducible. Moreover, the scientists face the challenge of learning new unfamiliar tools and workflows. In this contribution, we will look at a graduate-level course syllabus covering several software tools which make validation and reuse by a wider professional community possible. For the novices in the open science arena, we will look at how scripting languages such as Python and Bash help us reproduce research (starting with our own work). Jupyter Notebook will be introduced as a code editor, data exploration tool, and a lab notebook. We will see how Git helps us not to get lost in revisions and how Docker is used to wrap all the parts together using a single text file so that figures for a scientific paper or a technical report can be generated with a single command. We will look at examples of software and publications in the geospatial domain which use these tools and principles. Scientific contributions to GRASS GIS, a powerful open source desktop GIS and geoprocessing backend, will serve as an example of why and how to publish new algorithms and tools as part of a bigger open source project.

% Open science uses open source to deal with reproducibility in data and computational sciences, but just using open source or making the code public does not make the research reproducible. In this contribution, we present a syllabus for open science graduate-level course. The course covers several software tools and workflows which make validation and reuse of research possible and much easier. The course further covers scripting and automation, interactive notebooks, tracking of changes, and sharing research in a way. The course shows examples of software and publications in the geospatial domain which use these tools and principles. This contribution will specifically show scientific contributions to GRASS GIS, a powerful open source desktop GIS and geoprocessing backend, as a use case of publishing new algorithms in a large and established open source project.

\block{\blocktitlewrap{Scripting}}{

\LARGE

Automation in lab work, repeatability by others, and review by peers is enabled by scripting.
However, the natural way to capture workflows in graphical user interface is
taking screenshots such as this series from GRASS GIS:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{r_in_lidar_1}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{r_in_lidar_2}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{r_in_lidar_3}
\end{center}

Scripting is a more efficient way of recording the same information
which can be edited and automatically processed.
The following Bash command is equivalent of the three screenshots above:

\Large

\begin{center}
% Bash and GRASS GIS:\\
\texttt{r.in.lidar input=points.las output=elevation -e}\\
% Python and GRASS GIS:\\
% \texttt{run\_command("r.in.lidar", input="points.las", output="elevation", flags="e")}\\

Publishing code can be as simple as uploading file online using a web browser,
however more advanced ways such as integration into a larger open source project
bring many benefits.

Why?
Preprocessing, visualization, and user interface (GUI, CLI, API),
inputs, outputs, memory management and other common features,
integration with existing analytical tools,
long-term maintenance.
Options: R package, Python package, GRASS GIS module, QGIS plugin, ...
Integration gradient: unofficial extension - integrated extension - code addition.
Licensing and criteria to choosing the project \citep{schweik2012internet}
need to be part of the course.
