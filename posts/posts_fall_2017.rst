Welcome and first week instructions
-----------------------------------

Welcome to the Tools for Open Geospatial Science course which will uncover the world of reproducible science.

This week our team of instructors is at FOSS4G (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) conference. Consequently, there is no on-campus meeting, but there is an online material for everybody to follow here:

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/open-science.html

Please, read the text, review the provided resources, and follow the instructions for the assignment. Assignment answers are submitted as responses in the forum Assignment 1: Open science.

The on-campus section meets on Wed 3:00-4:50pm in 5119 Jordan Hall. For the students in the on-line section, to help you navigate the course material I will be sending you an email at the beginning of each week about the topic and assignment for that week.

Both sections will follow the schedule where you can find links to all class materials:

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/

We will use Moodle for homework submission and for providing homework feedback. For communication we will use Moodle forums and email.


Week 2: Collaborative writing of scientific papers
--------------------------------------------------

These are instructions for assignment for this week and link to resources for the distance education section. If you were not in the class on campus, read through the following page, follow instructions in Authorea section, and optionally review the linked materials.

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/collaborative-writing.html

Then write a paragraph or two using about Authorea or Creative Commons into the following documents. Use Markdown to write it. Include a heading of the topic you are writing about and some other formating. Pick a topic which is not yet described by another student.

If writing about Authorea the topics may include: using Markdown, using the default editor, using LaTeX, including figures, tables, exports, imports, account policies and payments, etc. Try out the feature as you are writing about it. If writing about Creative Commons, the topics may include: description of a specific license, advantages and disadvantages, use cases, etc. Feel free to search for existing texts and draw from them (and cite and quote them).

I will try to give access to everybody in the class, but if you don't get it, please tell me. The links to the documents follow.

Authorea: ...

Creative Commons: ...

Some general notes: The assignments are due next week on Wednesday.

If you have some troubles with the assignments, please post a new topic to the Assignments forum.

Thanks everybody for the descriptions and comments about the open science talks and articles.


Week 3: Advanced tools for papers and reports
---------------------------------------------

Thank you for completing the assignment last week and I encourage everybody to read what others studied and described. The assignment for this week follows.

First, study the resources about Overleaf, LaTeX, Pandoc, and reStructuredText provided on the course website:

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/advanced-writing.html

Try using LaTeX on Overleaf. You don't need an account, but if you register (for free) you get an access to little more features. If you prefer you can use LaTeX on your desktop as well, the course website gives some pointers.

For the assignment, take some of your documents which contain headings, figures, tables, equations, and bibliography and recreate it in LaTeX. If you don't have a suitable document, you can use `this paper <https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40965-017-0021-8>`_ or any other suitable document which contains all or most of the aforementioned elements. Scientific papers will usually work. If you are writing a report for assignment from another class, you can use that as well. For GIS/MEA582 we suggest `this template <https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri%5B%5D=http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/resources/latex_report_template.tex&snip_uri%5B%5D=http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/resources/report_template_image.png&rich_text=true>`_ (the linked document opens in Overleaf). In any case, you don't have to recreate the whole document, include just enough to try each of the elements.

Alternatively, if you already familiar with LaTeX, extend the following LaTeX document in Overleaf by providing a comprehensive description of some basic feature such as tables, equations or bibliography, or introduction to some advanced feature or package. Here is a read-write link for document:

https://www.overleaf.com/10827501jcjjzftsddqr

Three more alternative or bonus tasks: Create some other type of document in LaTeX other than a paper, for example poster or presentation slides (link a read-only version in the document linked above). Install LaTeX on your computer and try the workflow on your desktop instead of using Overleaf. Upload your resulting document to Overleaf and link it and describe in the above document what your installed and did and what were the other options you had. Use Pandoc, Docutils or Sphinx to create a LaTeX document from some other format such as reStructuredText. Again, upload and link the result and describe the process.

Search online and post to message board if you have some issues with or questions about LaTeX or the other tools.

In case you are creating a new document (as opposed to exploring and describing in detail some specific feature), please, share the link in the assignment thread.


Week 4: Revision control systems
--------------------------------

Here are the instructions for this week. Study the text provided on this week's topic page. You can use the additional linked resources as well. The videos will be good for absolute beginners and the texts and documentation in case you already know a little bit about Git. Please note also the section about software licenses. The assignment is at the end of the web page. The purpose of the assignment is to get comfortable with the workflow, so if you want to use different commands than what the page suggests, feel free to do that.

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/revision-control.html

For this assignment, you don't need to submit any link or text on Moodle unless you want to get some feedback. In that case, ask on Moodle as usually. On the other hand, the last part of the assignment requires everybody to submit pull request (see the assignment).

People who were in the on campus class, don't need to do the Overleaf+Git part of the assignment as that overlaps with what we did in the class.

If you see something like Git for the first time, this topic may feel like the most challenging one in this class. That actually may be true. So don't get discouraged, give it some time, and ask questions. We will continue using Git in this class and we will have some opportunities to reiterate some of the concepts again.


Week 5: Open source
-------------------

This week watch the provided talk or go through the Lecture slides or both if you were not in the on campus class. In any case, follow the assignment on the website:

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/open-source.html

This topic is mostly about the concepts and terms in open source and also about becoming an aware user. If you have troubles grasping some of them or have additional questions, please do ask, I will either point you to additional resources or try to answer myself.

As for Git and GitHub, congratulations to those who completed the assignment and please, all, continue asking questions about it as you are working through it or using it further.


Week 6: Linux command line
--------------------------

Go through the `instructions <https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/linux.html>`_ for this week. You can use NCSU VCL, specifically one of the Ubuntu machines. When you login in into the machine, use terminal to input commands. Alternatively, you can use terminal on Mac OS or Git Bash from the last class if you are using MS Windows but you may not be able to do all the steps. If you were in the class, you can skip this part and do the next one right away.

In some Linux command line (e.g. in NCSU VCL Ubuntu machine), find out how many CPUs has the machine you are working on. To find out that information, use file called /proc/cpuinfo which contains information about CPUs. Construct command line which will in one command print the number of CPUs, but nothing more. Post the command as a (online) text in Moodle. I created an assignment for it in Moodle.

Please do post questions to the forum as you are going through the provided material, just don't post possible solutions for that CPU command, so that others can come up with their own solutions.

Week 7: Command line and Python tools for geospatial work
---------------------------------------------------------

Go through the instructions and examples about GDAL. For smooth experience, it is recommended to use NCSU VCL Ubuntu machine, but testing GDAL on your own computer is highly encouraged.

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/geospatial-command-line.html

Then take the part which is resampling the rasters and creating and animated GIF and create a Bash script which does this procedure without repeating commands. If possible, include also download of the file and its unpacking of needed so that your result can be reproduced on any computer. Submit this file to Moodle.

I recommend you to do the assignment before October 18 (GRASS GIS as software for geospatial research) where you can use what you learn from this assignment.


Week 8: Publishing data on web
------------------------------

Here is the assignment for this week: Explore the general repositories for scientific data linked in the class material and search for a repository which is used in your field. If you find something what is not on the list, you can share it on the message board (in the discussion in the Assignments forum).

Then go through the instructions to create your own simple, but interactive web map showing a raster and vector and publish it through GitHub. Send the link to the repository and to the web page online to the message board (again, to the Assignments forum).

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/data.html

If you did some of these things in the class, you don't need to do them again, but in any case, publish the web page through GitHub as described in the instructions.


Week 9: QGIS, a free and open source geographic system
------------------------------------------------------

This week is dedicated to learning QGIS.

On campus students: Please, install QGIS on your computer before you come to class on Wednesday (if you have a problem, you can always use NCSU VCL).

Online students: Please, also install QGIS and go through one of the linked (text or video) tutorials. It is up to you how much do you want to do, but at the end, you should be comfortable with using QGIS for basic geospatial tasks.

If you already know QGIS, you may want skip the tutorials and dedicate the time to exploring some feature or features you don't know.

As always, ask on message board if you have some issues and you can also share some things you learned if you want.


Week 10: GRASS GIS as platform for open science
-----------------------------------------------

This week we are exploring GRASS GIS as platform for open science

https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/grass.html

See the recorded talk about GRASS GIS linked from the class material. I have also included links to HTML slides for this talk and for a related presentation focused on dynamic visualizations.

In addition to providing overview of GRASS GIS evolution and features related to research, the presentations highlight connection of GRASS modules and tools to published scientific papers which you will find on several slides and GRASS manual pages, such as these (scroll down to see the references, link to source code and recent history of changes):

https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/v.surf.rst.html

https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.watershed

To gain some hands-on experience with GRASS GIS, I highly recommend that you go at least through some sections of the workshop "From GRASS GIS novice to power user" - see the link on the webpage or here:

https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/From_GRASS_GIS_novice_to_power_user_(workshop_at_FOSS4G_Boston_2017)

Even if you are familiar with GRASS GIS, you will likely learn something new as did the participants of the FOSS4G Boston workshop.

In class we looked at running GRASS GIS commands from the shell and saving the history file, you can try it yourself following the "Recording your work in GRASS GIS" section on this topic's webpage.

For an Assignment, there is a link to a recent paper:

"Fusion of high-resolution DEMs for water flow modeling"

https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40965-017-0019-2

which presents a technique for updating lidar-based DEM with 3D data acquired by UAS(drone) using GRASS GIS. You should try to reproduce the results presented in this paper - e.g. can you generate the same image as Fig. 3?
